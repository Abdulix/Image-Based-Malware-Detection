        <h2>Malwares</h2>
        <p>
        Malware, short for malicious software, 
        refers to any software designed to harm or exploit devices, 
        networks, or users. Common types include viruses, worms, ransomware, and spyware, 
        often spread through malicious websites, email attachments, or infected software. 
        Effective cybersecurity measures are essential to prevent and mitigate the impact of malware.

        <h2>Trojans</h2>
        <p>
        Trojans are a type of malware disguised as legitimate software, 
        deceiving users into unknowingly installing them. Unlike viruses or worms, 
        trojans don't replicate themselves but can enable unauthorized access, data theft, 
        or system manipulation. They often rely on social engineering to trick users and highlight 
        the importance of cautious online behavior and robust cybersecurity practices.

        <h2>Ransomwares</h2>
        <p>
        Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a user's files or entire system, 
        rendering them inaccessible. Attackers then demand a ransom, usually in cryptocurrency, 
        in exchange for providing the decryption key. Ransomware often spreads through email attachments, 
        malicious links, or vulnerabilities in software, emphasizing the need for regular backups, 
        strong cybersecurity measures, and user awareness to mitigate the risk of infection.

        <h2>RootKit</h2>
        <p>
        A rootkit is a type of malicious software designed to conceal its presence or the presence of 
        other malicious processes on a system. It often grants unauthorized access and control 
        to the attacker by exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system. 
        Rootkits can be challenging to detect and remove, as they typically operate at a deep level 
        within the system, allowing attackers to maintain persistent and surreptitious access to the 
        compromised device. 
        </p>

      <div className="blog-post">
        <h2>Spyware </h2>
        <p>
        Spyware is a type of malicious software that secretly gathers information about a user's online activities,
         often without their knowledge or consent. It can track keystrokes, capture passwords, 
         monitor browsing habits, and compromise sensitive data. 
        </p>

        <h2>Benign</h2>
        <p>
        Benign files refer to non-malicious and harmless software or data. 
        These files are typically safe and serve legitimate purposes, such as system files, 
        applications, or user-generated content. Unlike malicious files, benign files do not 
        pose a threat to the integrity or security of a computer system.
        Examples include documents, images, and programs that are intended for regular and lawful use
